# BICEP2/Keck Array likelihood, including external data from Planck and WMAP.
#
# This file contains input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the likelihoods of the 
# alternate analysis excluding WMAP maps, from Figure 17 of BICEP2/Keck VI. 
# For details of the parameters in the baseline model, see BK14only.ini and BK14.ini, 
# and comments therein.
#
# After generating chains, BK14_05_noWMAP_dist.ini can be used with getdist to 
# produce plots of marginalized posteriors.
