# BICEP2/Keck Array likelihood, including external data from Planck and WMAP.
#
# This file contains input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the likelihoods of the 
# alternate analysis including E-modes from Figure 17 of BICEP2/Keck VI. The EE/BB 
# ratios for dust and synchrotron are fixed to 2.
# For details of the parameters in the baseline model, see BK14only.ini and BK14.ini, 
# and comments therein.
#
# After generating chains, BK14_07_incE_dist.ini can be used with getdist to 
# produce plots of marginalized posteriors.
